# Introduction

- Spring framework was created as an alternative to J2EE (J2EE was renamed to Java EE and then to Jakarta EE)
- Spring provides Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming, and many other features to simplify Java development.
- Spring provides many modules (Jdbc, ORM, Security, Batch, etc) to build enterprise applications.
- Spring initially provided XML based configuration, but later introduced Java based configuration and annotations.
- However, configuring Spring applications were still challenging and usually involved a lot of boilerplate code copy-pasted from previous projects.
- Spring Boot is created to simplify the process of creating Spring applications.
- Spring Boot provides opinionated defaults, auto-configuration, and starter dependencies to reduce boilerplate code and make development faster.
- Spring Boot also provides embedded servers support to run applications as fat/uber jar.

**I strongly believe that the best way to learn a new technology is to build something with it.**

**Throughout this guide, you will learn how to use Spring Boot by building a Blog REST API (called jblogger) progressively.
In this guide, each section will explain a specific feature of Spring Boot and will give an assignment to build jblogger**

## jblogger
- Admin user can create, update, delete posts.
- Users can register and login.
- Anonymous users can view posts.
- Authenticated users can add comments.
- Admin users can view and delete comments.

Though it is a very simple REST API, it covers most of the Spring Boot features and best practices.

### Database
- We will use the PostgreSQL database for this guide. But you can use any database of your choice.
- We will use Flyway for database migrations.
- We will run PostgreSQL in a Docker container using Docker Compose.
